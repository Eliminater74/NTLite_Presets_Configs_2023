# NTLite_win11_config
My personal win11 NTLite config



This my NTLite config is based of latest Finnish Windows 11 ISO.
So if you want to use this, beware that everything will be in Finnish
But you can of course change the language and keyboard layout after installing.

For obvious reasons I can't provide the ISO file (Microsoft will send you to prison if you do that)
